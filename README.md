Scratch repo, random name fits!

Just testing, now with exports on these two functions: 

matchThree will return all orders and combinations of valid markets.  The markets are presented in 
an array like [[usd, cny], [btc, usd], [btc, cny]] so any formatting will have to be stripped
and re-added.

repeats will return a stripped list from the matchThree output, with out any combinational repeats.
